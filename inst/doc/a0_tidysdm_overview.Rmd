# SDMs with `tidymodels`

Species Distribution Modelling relies on several algorithms, many of which
have a number of hyperparameters that require turning. The `tidymodels` universe
includes a number of packages specifically design to fit, tune and validate
models. The advantage of `tidymodels` is that the models syntax and the results
returned to the users are standardised, thus providing a coherent interface to
modelling. Given the variety of models required for SDM, `tidymodels` is an
ideal framework. `tidysdm` provides a number of wrappers and specialised
functions to facilitate the fitting of SDM with `tidymodels`.

This article provides an overview of the how `tidysdm` facilitates fitting
SDMs. Further articles, detailing how to use the package for palaeodata, 
fitting more complex models and how to troubleshoot models can be found
on the [`tidisdm` website](https://evolecolgroup.github.io/tidysdm/). 
As `tidysdm` relies on `tidymodels`, users are advised to familiarise 
themselves with the introductory
tutorials on the [`tidymodels` website](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/).

When we load `tidysdm`, it automatically loads `tidymodels` and all associated
packages necessary to fit models:

```r
library(tidysdm)
```

# Preparing your data

We start by reading in a set of presences for a species of lizard that inhabits
the Iberian peninsula, *Lacerta schreiberi*.

```r
data(lacerta)
lacerta
#> # A tibble: 1,297 × 3
#>           ID latitude longitude
#>        <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
#>  1 858029749     42.6     -7.09
#>  2 858029738     42.6     -7.09
#>  3 614631090     41.4     -7.90

#> 10 614559657     40.4     -7.56
#> # ℹ 1,287 more rows
```

First, let us visualise our presences by plotting on a map. `tidysdm` works
with `sf` objects to represent locations, so we will cast our coordinates
into an `sf` object, and set its projections to standard lonlat (crs = 4326).


```r
library(sf)
lacerta <- st_as_sf(lacerta, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"))
st_crs(lacerta) <- 4326
```

It is usually
advisable to plot the locations directly on the raster that will be used to
extract climatic variables, to see how the locations fall within the discrete
space of the raster. For this vignette, we will use WorldClim as our source of
climatic information. We will access the WorldClim data via the library `pastclim`;
even though this library, as the name suggests, is mostly designed to handle palaeoclimatic
reconstructions, it also provides convenient functions to access present day
reconstructions and future projections. `pastclim` has a handy function to get
the land mask for the available datasets, which we can use as background for our
locations. We will cut the raster to the Iberian peninsula, where 
our lizard lives. For this simply illustration, we will not bother to
project the raster, but an equal area projection would be desirable...


```r
library(pastclim)
land_mask <-
  get_land_mask(time_ce = 1985, dataset = "WorldClim_2.1_10m")

# Iberia peninsula extension
iberia_poly <-
  terra::vect(
    "POLYGON((-9.8 43.3,-7.8 44.1,-2.0 43.7,3.6 42.5,3.8 41.5,1.3 40.8,0.3 39.5,
     0.9 38.6,-0.4 37.5,-1.6 36.7,-2.3 36.3,-4.1 36.4,-4.5 36.4,-5.0 36.1,
    -5.6 36.0,-6.3 36.0,-7.1 36.9,-9.5 36.6,-9.4 38.0,-10.6 38.9,-9.5 40.8,
    -9.8 43.3))"
  )

crs(iberia_poly) <- "lonlat"
# crop the extent
land_mask <- crop(land_mask, iberia_poly)
# and mask to the polygon
land_mask <- mask(land_mask, iberia_poly)
```



For
plotting, we will take advantage of `tidyterra`, which makes handling of `terra`
rasters with `ggplot` a breeze. 


```r
library(tidyterra)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = land_mask, aes(fill = land_mask_1985)) +
  geom_sf(data = lacerta)
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

# Thinning step

Now, we thin the observations to have one per cell in the raster (it would be better
if we had an equal area projection...):

```r
set.seed(1234567)
lacerta <- thin_by_cell(lacerta, raster = land_mask)
nrow(lacerta)
#> [1] 231
```


```r
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = land_mask, aes(fill = land_mask_1985)) +
  geom_sf(data = lacerta)
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/plot_thin_by_cell-1.png)

Now, we thin further to remove points that are closer than 20km. However, note that
the standard map units for a 'lonlat' projection are meters. `tidysdm` provides
a convening conversion function, `km2m()`, to avoid having to write lots of zeroes):

```r
set.seed(1234567)
lacerta_thin <- thin_by_dist(lacerta, dist_min = km2m(20))
nrow(lacerta_thin)
#> [1] 113
```

Let's see what we have left of our points:

```r
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = land_mask, aes(fill = land_mask_1985)) +
  geom_sf(data = lacerta_thin)
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/plot_thin_by_dist-1.png)

Now we sample pseudo-absences (we will constrain them to be at least 50km away
from any presences), selecting as 3 times as many points as presences:

```r
set.seed(1234567)
lacerta_thin <- sample_pseudoabs(lacerta_thin,
  n = 3 * nrow(lacerta_thin),
  raster = land_mask,
  method = c("dist_min", km2m(50))
)
```

Let's see our presences and absences:

```r
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = land_mask, aes(fill = land_mask_1985)) +
  geom_sf(data = lacerta_thin, aes(col = class))
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/plot_sample_pseudoabs-1.png)

Generally, we can use `pastclim` to check what variables are 
available for the WorldClim dataset:

```r
climate_vars <- get_vars_for_dataset("WorldClim_2.1_10m")
```




We first download the dataset at the right resolution (here 10 arc-minutes):

```r
download_dataset("WorldClim_2.1_10m")
```

And then create a `terra` SpatRaster object. The dataset covers the period 1970-2000,
so `pastclim` dates it as 1985 (the midpoint). 
We can directly crop to the Iberian peninsula:

```r
climate_present <- pastclim::region_slice(
  time_ce = 1985,
  bio_variables = climate_vars,
  data = "WorldClim_2.1_10m",
  crop = iberia_poly
)
```

We start by selecting variables for which presences are markedly different from
the underlying background. First, let's extract climate for all presences and
pseudo-absences:

```r
lacerta_thin <- lacerta_thin %>%
  bind_cols(terra::extract(climate_present, lacerta_thin, ID = FALSE))
```

We can use violin plots to compare the distribution of the climatic variables for presences and pseudo-absences:


```r
lacerta_thin %>% plot_pres_vs_bg(class)
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)
We want to choose variables for which presences use values different from the background (pseudo-absences).
We can qualitatively look at the plots, or use a quantitative approach that ranks them based on the
overlap of the respective density plots:

```r
lacerta_thin %>% dist_pres_vs_bg(class)
#>     bio19     bio12     bio16     bio02     bio13     bio07     bio05     bio04     bio09     bio10     bio17 
#> 0.6935026 0.6929654 0.6885097 0.6776561 0.6679894 0.6542063 0.6243068 0.6071527 0.5506741 0.4855064 0.4318872 
#>     bio15     bio18     bio06     bio08     bio14     bio11     bio03     bio01  altitude 
#> 0.4241999 0.3600587 0.3454245 0.3108560 0.2954351 0.2317079 0.2173934 0.2045136 0.1554400
```

As a first step, we can focus on variables that have at least 30% of non-overlapping distribution
between presences and pseudo-absences:


```r
vars_to_keep <- lacerta_thin %>% dist_pres_vs_bg(class)
vars_to_keep <- names(vars_to_keep[vars_to_keep > 0.30])
lacerta_thin <- lacerta_thin %>% select(all_of(c(vars_to_keep, "class")))
vars_to_keep
#>  [1] "bio19" "bio12" "bio16" "bio02" "bio13" "bio07" "bio05" "bio04" "bio09" "bio10" "bio17" "bio15" "bio18"
#> [14] "bio06" "bio08"
```

These are still a lot of variables. Among them, there are several that have been argued in the past
to be important for the distribution of the species of interest. Based on
this paper (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-010-9865-2), we are interested in:


```r
suggested_vars <- c("bio05", "bio06", "bio13", "bio14", "bio15")
```

Environmental variables are often highly correlated, and collinearity is an issue
for several types of models. We can inspect the correlation among variables with:

```r
pairs(climate_present[[suggested_vars]])
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

We can see that some variables have rather high correlation (e.g. bio05 vs bio14).
We can subset to variables below a certain threshold correlation (e.g. 0.7) with:


```r
climate_present <- climate_present[[suggested_vars]]
vars_uncor <- filter_high_cor(climate_present, cutoff = 0.7)
vars_uncor
#> [1] "bio15" "bio05" "bio13" "bio06"
#> attr(,"to_remove")
#> [1] "bio14"
```

So, removing bio14 leaves us with a set of uncorrelated variables.


```r
lacerta_thin <- lacerta_thin %>% select(all_of(c(vars_uncor, "class")))
climate_present <- climate_present[[vars_uncor]]
```


# Fit the model by cross-validation

Next, we need to set up a `recipe` to define how to handle our dataset. We don't
want to do anything to our data in terms of transformations, so we just
need to define the formula (*class* is the `outcome`,
all other variables are `predictor`s; note that, for `sf` objects, `geometry` is
automatically replaced by `X` and `Y` columns which are assigned a role of
`coords`, and thus not used as predictors):

```r
lacerta_rec <- recipe(lacerta_thin, formula = class ~ .)
lacerta_rec
#> 
#> ── Recipe ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> 
#> ── Inputs
#> Number of variables by role
#> outcome:   1
#> predictor: 4
#> coords:    2
```

In classification models for `tidymodels`, the assumption is that the level of
interest for the response (in our case, presences) is the reference level. We
can confirm that we have the data correctly formatted with:

```r
lacerta_thin %>% check_sdm_presence(class)
#> [1] TRUE
```

We now build a `workflow_set` of different models, defining which 
hyperparameters we want to tune. We will use *glm*, *random forest*,
*boosted_trees* and *maxent* as
our models (for more details on how
to use `workflow_set`s, see [this tutorial](https://workflowsets.tidymodels.org/articles/tuning-and-comparing-models.html)). The latter three models have tunable hyperparameters. For the most
commonly used models, `tidysdm` automatically chooses the most important
parameters, but it is possible to fully customise model specifications (e.g. see the
help for `sdm_spec_rf`). 


```r
lacerta_models <-
  # create the workflow_set
  workflow_set(
    preproc = list(default = lacerta_rec),
    models = list(
      # the standard glm specs
      glm = sdm_spec_glm(),
      # rf specs with tuning
      rf = sdm_spec_rf(),
      # boosted tree model (gbm) specs with tuning
      gbm = sdm_spec_boost_tree(),
      # maxent specs with tuning
      maxent = sdm_spec_maxent()
    ),
    # make all combinations of preproc and models,
    cross = TRUE
  ) %>%
  # tweak controls to store information needed later to create the ensemble
  option_add(control = control_ensemble_grid())
```

We now want to set up a spatial block cross-validation scheme to tune and assess
our models. We will do an 80:20 split, by creating 5 folds. We use the 
`spatial_block_cv` function from the package `spatialsample`. `spatialsample`
offers a number of sampling approaches for spatial data; it is also possible to
convert objects created with `blockCV` (which offers further features
for spatial sampling) into an `rsample` object suitable to `tisysdm` with the
function `blockcv2rsample`.


```r
library(tidysdm)
set.seed(100)
lacerta_cv <- spatial_block_cv(lacerta_thin, v = 5)
autoplot(lacerta_cv)
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/training_cv-1.png)

We can now use the block CV folds to
tune and assess the models (to keep computations fast, we will only explore 3
combination of hyperparameters per model; this is far too little in real life!):

```r
set.seed(1234567)
lacerta_models <-
  lacerta_models %>%
  workflow_map("tune_grid",
    resamples = lacerta_cv, grid = 3,
    metrics = sdm_metric_set(), verbose = TRUE
  )
#> i	No tuning parameters. `fit_resamples()` will be attempted
#> i 1 of 4 resampling: default_glm
#> ✔ 1 of 4 resampling: default_glm (881ms)
#> i 2 of 4 tuning:     default_rf
#> i Creating pre-processing data to finalize unknown parameter: mtry
#> ✔ 2 of 4 tuning:     default_rf (1.5s)
#> i 3 of 4 tuning:     default_gbm
#> i Creating pre-processing data to finalize unknown parameter: mtry
#> ✔ 3 of 4 tuning:     default_gbm (7.5s)
#> i 4 of 4 tuning:     default_maxent
#> ✔ 4 of 4 tuning:     default_maxent (2.9s)
```

Note that `workflow_set` correctly detects that we have no tuning parameters for 
*glm*. We can have a look at the performance of our models with:


```r
autoplot(lacerta_models)
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/autoplot_models-1.png)

Now let's create an ensemble, selecting the best set of parameters for each model
(this is really only relevant for the random forest, as there were not hype-parameters
to tune for the glm and gam). We will use the Boyce continuous index as our metric
to choose the best random forest and boosted tree. When adding members to an ensemble, they are
automatically fitted to the full training dataset, and so ready to make predictions.


```r
lacerta_ensemble <- simple_ensemble() %>%
  add_member(lacerta_models, metric = "boyce_cont")
lacerta_ensemble
#> A simple_ensemble of models
#> 
#> Members:
#> • default_glm
#> • default_rf
#> • default_gbm
#> • default_maxent
#> 
#> Available metrics:
#> • boyce_cont
#> • roc_auc
#> • tss_max
#> 
#> Metric used to tune workflows:
#> • boyce_cont
```

And visualise it

```r
autoplot(lacerta_ensemble)
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/autoplot_ens-1.png)

# Projecting to the present
We can now make predictions with this ensemble (using the default option of taking
the mean of the predictions from each model).


```r
prediction_present <- predict_raster(lacerta_ensemble, climate_present)
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = prediction_present, aes(fill = mean)) +
  scale_fill_terrain_c() +
  # plot presences used in the model
  geom_sf(data = lacerta_thin %>% filter(class == "presence"))
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/plot_present-1.png)

We can subset the ensemble to only use the best models, based on the Boyce continuous index,
by setting a minimum threshold of 0.8 for that metric. We will also take the 
median of the available model predictions (instead of the mean, which is the default).
The plot does not change much (the models are
quite consistent).


```r
prediction_present_boyce <- predict_raster(lacerta_ensemble, climate_present,
  metric_thresh = c("boyce_cont", 0.8),
  fun = "median"
)
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = prediction_present_boyce, aes(fill = median)) +
  scale_fill_terrain_c() +
  geom_sf(data = lacerta_thin %>% filter(class == "presence"))
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/plot_present_best-1.png)
Sometimes, it is desirable to have binary predictions (presence vs absence), rather
than the probability of occurrence. To do so, we first need to calibrate the threshold
used to convert probabilities into classes (in this case, we optimise the TSS):

```r
lacerta_ensemble <- calib_class_thresh(lacerta_ensemble,
  class_thresh = "tss_max"
)
```

And now we can predict for the whole continent:

```r
prediction_present_binary <- predict_raster(lacerta_ensemble,
  climate_present,
  type = "class",
  class_thresh = c("tss_max")
)
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = prediction_present_binary, aes(fill = binary_mean)) +
  geom_sf(data = lacerta_thin %>% filter(class == "presence"))
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

# Projecting to the future
WorldClim has a wide selection of projections for the future based on different
models and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP). Type `help("WorldClim_2.1")`
for a full list. We will use predictions based on "HadGEM3-GC31-LL" model for SSP 245 (intermediate green
house gas emissions) at the same resolution as the present day data (10 arc-minutes). We first download the data:

```r
download_dataset("WorldClim_2.1_HadGEM3-GC31-LL_ssp245_10m")
```
Let's see what times are available:

```r
get_time_ce_steps("WorldClim_2.1_HadGEM3-GC31-LL_ssp245_10m")
```


```
#> [1] 2030 2050 2070 2090
```

We will predict for 2090, the further prediction in the future that is available. 

Let's now check the available variables:

```r
get_vars_for_dataset("WorldClim_2.1_HadGEM3-GC31-LL_ssp245_10m")
```


```
#>  [1] "bio01" "bio02" "bio03" "bio04" "bio05" "bio06" "bio07" "bio08" "bio09" "bio10" "bio11" "bio12" "bio13"
#> [14] "bio14" "bio15" "bio16" "bio17" "bio18" "bio19"
```

Note that future predictions do not include *altitude* (as that does not change with time), 
so if we needed it, we would have to copy it over from the present. 
However, it is not in our set of uncorrelated variables that
we used earlier, so we don't need to worry about it.

```r
climate_future <- pastclim::region_slice(
  time_ce = 2090,
  bio_variables = vars_uncor,
  data = "WorldClim_2.1_HadGEM3-GC31-LL_ssp245_10m",
  crop = iberia_poly
)
```




And predict using the ensemble:

```r
prediction_future <- predict_raster(lacerta_ensemble, climate_future)

ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = prediction_future, aes(fill = mean)) +
  scale_fill_terrain_c()
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/plot_future-1.png)

# Visualising the contribution of individual variables

It is sometimes of interest to understand the relative contribution of
individual variables to the prediction. This is a complex task, especially if
there are interactions among variables. For simpler linear models, it is possible
to obtain marginal response curves (which show the effect of a variable whilst
keeping all other variables to their mean) using `step_profile()` from the
`recipes` package. We use `step_profile()` to define a new recipe which we
can then bake to generate the appropriate dataset
to make the marginal prediction. We can then plot the predictions
against the values of the variable of interest. For example,
to investigate the contribution of `bio05`, we would:


```r
bio05_prof <- lacerta_rec %>%
  step_profile(-bio05, profile = vars(bio05)) %>%
  prep(training = lacerta_thin)

bio05_data <- bake(bio05_prof, new_data = NULL)

bio05_data <- bio05_data %>%
  mutate(
    pred = predict(lacerta_ensemble, bio05_data)$mean
  )

ggplot(bio05_data, aes(x = bio05, y = pred)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5, cex = 1)
```

![](figure_a0_tidysdm_overview/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)

It is also possible to use [DALEX](https://modeloriented.github.io/DALEX/),to
explore `tidysdm` models; see more details in the [tidymodels additions](https://evolecolgroup.github.io/tidysdm/dev/articles/a2_tidymodels_additions.html)
article.


# Repeated ensembles

The steps of thinning and sampling pseudo-absences can have a bit impact on the
performance of SDMs. As these steps are stochastic, it is good practice to
explore their effect by repeating them, and then creating ensembles of models
over these repeats. In `tidysdm`, it is possible to create `repeat_ensembles`.
We start by creating a list of `simple_ensembles`, by looping through the
SDM pipeline. We will just use two fast models to speed up the process.


```r
# empty object to store the simple ensembles that we will create
ensemble_list <- list()
set.seed(123) # make sure you set the seed OUTSIDE the loop
for (i_repeat in 1:3) {
  # thin the data
  lacerta_thin_rep <- thin_by_cell(lacerta, raster = climate_present)
  lacerta_thin_rep <- thin_by_dist(lacerta_thin_rep, dist_min = 20000)
  # sample pseudo-absences
  lacerta_thin_rep <- sample_pseudoabs(lacerta_thin_rep,
    n = 3 * nrow(lacerta_thin_rep),
    raster = climate_present,
    method = c("dist_min", 50000)
  )
  # get climate
  lacerta_thin_rep <- lacerta_thin_rep %>%
    bind_cols(terra::extract(climate_present, lacerta_thin_rep, ID = FALSE))
  # create folds
  lacerta_thin_rep_cv <- spatial_block_cv(lacerta_thin_rep, v = 5)
  # create a recipe
  lacerta_thin_rep_rec <- recipe(lacerta_thin_rep, formula = class ~ .)
  # create a workflow_set
  lacerta_thin_rep_models <-
    # create the workflow_set
    workflow_set(
      preproc = list(default = lacerta_thin_rep_rec),
      models = list(
        # the standard glm specs
        glm = sdm_spec_glm(),
        # maxent specs with tuning
        maxent = sdm_spec_maxent()
      ),
      # make all combinations of preproc and models,
      cross = TRUE
    ) %>%
    # tweak controls to store information needed later to create the ensemble
    option_add(control = control_ensemble_grid())

  # train the model
  lacerta_thin_rep_models <-
    lacerta_thin_rep_models %>%
    workflow_map("tune_grid",
      resamples = lacerta_thin_rep_cv, grid = 10,
      metrics = sdm_metric_set(), verbose = TRUE
    )
  # make an simple ensemble and add it to the list
  ensemble_list[[i_repeat]] <- simple_ensemble() %>%
    add_member(lacerta_thin_rep_models, metric = "boyce_cont")
}

```

Now we can create a `repeat_ensemble` from the list:

```r
lacerta_thin_rep_ens <- repeat_ensemble() %>% add_repeat(ensemble_list)
lacerta_thin_rep_ens
#> A repeat_ensemble of models
#> 
#> Number of repeats:
#> • 3
#> 
#> Members:
#> • default_glm
#> • default_maxent
#> 
#> Available metrics:
#> • boyce_cont
#> • roc_auc
#> • tss_max
#> 
#> Metric used to tune workflows:
#> • boyce_cont
```

We can then predict in the usual way (we will take the mean and median of all models):

```r
lacerta_thin_rep_ens <- predict_raster(lacerta_thin_rep_ens, climate_present,
  fun = c("mean", "median")
)
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = lacerta_thin_rep_ens, aes(fill = median)) +
  scale_fill_terrain_c()
```
